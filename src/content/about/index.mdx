I can still recall the excitement I got after writing my first program as a little kid. I remember it vividly because it's the same thrill I get today after nearly **20 years** of coding. Writing code and seeing things work is a big _passion_ of mine which seems to be as strong as in day one for which I am truly grateful.

For most of my career, I've worked in **C++** and on projects that are quite performance-hungry and mainly lower level but I did chart out of my comfort zone and became skilled in web technologies as well through my multiple personal side-projects.
