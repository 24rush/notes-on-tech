Over the last six years, I have volunteered in various teaching and mentoring roles, either through programs organized by the companies I have worked for and more recently, through the amazing organization called [**Dalia's Book**](https://www.carteadaliei.ro/). I've been mostly conducting online **coding** classes in Scratch or Python with primary school students as well as **one-to-one** sessions with high school teens, assisting them in developing their first significant software projects and providing insights into software development along the way.

In this article, I will outline several qualities youngsters seek in a mentor, as well as some of their expectations from these non-formal educational systems. While my findings primarily stem from the field of computer science, they should be applicable across various disciplines.

## Traits of a great teacher/mentor

**Leader** - First and foremost, a great teacher needs to exhibit robust leadership as most formal educational systems (schools) often fall short in this area. Having the ability to guide and inspire others provides mentees with a sense of empowerment in their learning journey. Leadership typically comprises a combination of qualities, but in teaching, effective communication skills and a clear vision of classroom goals can be a good starting point. This involves the ability to articulate ideas, be an excellent listener and exhibit a confident attitude.

**Storytelling** - It is widely recognized that individuals tend to absorb and retain information more effectively when it is presented in a manner that evokes powerful emotions. Storytelling is one such powerful technique that can capture the attention of the audience and create lasting memories. By using engaging narratives, educators can not only elicit the curiosity of their audience but also establish a sense of connection with it.

**Analogical reasoning** - Much like storytelling, explaining complex topics, particularly to children requires a teacher to possess not only a vivid imagination but also a knowledge of the topics his audience already comprehends. In the field of computer programming, this is particularly important as most concepts are hard to grasp unless you can provide a suitable analogy.

**Humor** - People often take themselves too seriously and forget to enjoy the journey they're on. Formal education systems exemplify this as teachers tend to associate fun with chaos in the classroom so they avoid it at all costs. On the other hand, non-formal education systems fundamentally embrace the idea that people enroll with a desire to learn the subjects and they do it for having fun as well.

**Enthusiasm** - In the field of education, there may be nothing more powerful for engaging individuals than the display of genuine enthusiasm by those leading the process. When educators exhibit a genuine passion for the subject they are teaching, it becomes highly contagious, inspiring learners to become more motivated which not only fosters a positive learning environment but also encourages students to develop a love for the subject.

**Humbleness** - While this might be a forgotten trait in the ages we are living, it is an essential quality that will always resonate deeply with the human spirit. Humbleness in teaching creates an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding which allows students to feel more comfortable in expressing their thoughts, asking questions, and engaging in the learning process. By embodying humility, educators can not only foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment but also encourage students to develop a sense of empathy and compassion towards others, which are invaluable life skills.

## **Traits to cultivate in students**

In addition to the qualities a mentor should possess, there are also certain traits one needs to observe in mentees and try to foster them:

**Perseverance/resilience** - This is a key trait to have in any domain but is particularly important in a software development career. As future programmers, children must learn to embrace challenges and see obstacles as a normal part of the process, not as an exception. By cultivating perseverance, students will be better equipped to navigate the ever-evolving technological landscape and adapt to the fact that they need to continuously refine their skills.

**Growth mindset** - Traditional learning systems instill in students the belief that education has an endpoint and if you haven't acquired the knowledge till that point then you are helpless. It is crucial to shift the focus from this limiting perspective to one that views challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles and acknowledges that our current lack of knowledge is only temporary, as we all have gaps in our understanding that can be filled over time.

**Collaboration** - While it may seem like an obvious skill to possess in today's interconnected world, educational institutions often fall short in fostering a collaborative environment, continuing to emphasize learning as an exclusively individual pursuit. In software development, collaboration is not only a highly valued skill but an indispensable one, being at the core of all software development methodologies and given the ever-expanding landscape of technologies within this field, it has become increasingly challenging, if not impossible, for a single individual to achieve success without the support and cooperation of others.

**Curiosity** - learning doesn't scale if it solely relies on acquiring knowledge from a teacher that is why individual effort needs to be put in and the driving force behind this kind of *self-motivated* learning is curiosity. Although instilling curiosity can be the most challenging skill to transfer to mentees, educators must use their enthusiasm and passion in the subject they are teaching and try to devise fun, engaging, and thought-provoking project ideas that can spark curiosity and inspire them to delve deeper into the subject.

## **Other motivators**

Sometimes, even when educators excel in teaching, they might sense that something is off and that mentees are not fully engaged or convinced they should pursue the subject. The truth is that mentees have various reasons for pursuing non-formal education programs, and some common ones include:

- **they just want to figure out if computer science is for them** - this speaks for itself but the takeaway is that computer programming is still a sought-after profession which many individuals perceive as a lucrative and stable career choice. That is why, mentees may be drawn to such classes just to assess whether it aligns with their personal interests, skills and long-term aspirations but, most importantly, to determine if the field is as challenging as it is often portrayed and if they possess the aptitude and passion required to excel in it. By participating in these classes, mentees can gain valuable insights into the world of computer science, enabling them to make informed decisions about their future career paths.

- **to learn something new** - formal education systems are rigid and they are known to be obsolete when it comes to computer science that is why such non-formal education systems, on the other hand, are more adaptable and better aligned with the times in which we live. However, this also means that from the vast array of topics one can teach, the ones that present the most interest to mentees have to be selected which is often a challenging task.

- **to connect with new people** - social media has created an interconnected world where people have grown accustomed to having far more connections than in the past. Young people are eager to meet new and diverse individuals, and this type of activity is a great opportunity to do so. Especially for children, they are very enthusiastic about connecting on online gaming platforms outside of classes and forming strong bonds in this manner.

## Be the teacher you wanted to have

Teaching is in itself a complex profession that requires a deep understanding of not only one subject matter but often multiple subjects, along with pedagogical techniques and abilities to connect with students. Nevertheless, many teachers find immense satisfaction in witnessing the growth of their students. This sense of accomplishment is fueled primarily by the unique opportunity educators have to make a lasting impact on their students' lives and is further amplified when students, later on, achieve success in their chosen fields, knowing that their foundation was built upon the guidance and support of a dedicated teacher.
