During my journey in software development, I've been lucky enough to work with highly professional individuals, which gave me a strong insight into some aspiring values and mental models. In this article, I'm going to elaborate on some of these hidden traits of software engineering seniors.
## Composure
Software development is plagued with diverging opinions and while this diversity is valuable, it's often a reason for heated discussions. A senior is well aware of this dynamic and behaves accordingly. Expecting such situations, he finds them normal but, most importantly, sees them as a way to reach better decisions and not as a hit to his ego. 

Composure fosters a positive and collaborative working environment for everyone but also allows, in the heat of the moment, to better make sense of all the ideas flying through the room and reach a consensus sooner. 

Needless to say, kindness is something we must all exhibit, and in this context, itâ€™s the trait that makes individuals great mediators, promoting that harmony among the team members that reaches consensus sooner and in a more pleasant way.
## Reaches out and follows through
For most developers, their scope of responsibility rarely extends beyond the confines of their team. For anything falling outside this boundary, they will choose to ignore it or delegate it to whomever is usually required to handle such situations (scrum master, product owner). While in most cases this approach is reasonable, a seasoned developer knows that to handle a situation efficiently, you have to go in yourself, and in most cases that means reaching out to external teams and coordinating with them on reaching a resolution. 

I like to call this behavior 'end-to-end' problem solving and even though it's not fitting for everyone and all situations, I believe that, especially for technical issues, this is the way to go.

Solving such situations requires identifying the right people to reach out to, communicating and often reaching compromises with them, as well as the lesser glamorous trait of following through. That means that once you go down this road, you assume the responsibility of taking it till the end, which means staying in contact with the parties involved until it's done.
## Builds a network
The point made above will not work unless one builds a network of peers based on reciprocal relationships. You can't expect support if you are not willing to give it. This includes being there for counseling, code reviews, supporting initiatives and sometimes even being willing to take a hit for your peers. 

These are all trust-building mechanisms that will come into play in the long run, so even though for most people this might sound like an investment they are not willing to take, seniors know that it's the kind of investment that will pay dividends in the long run.

## Embraces and seeks discomfort
You might have heard this before, but what generally sets people apart is their ability to handle situations that others avoid. In software development, such situations range from interacting with people known to be hard to work with, taking on a difficult or mundane project, working on a legacy component, refactoring, maintenance, and the list can go on. 

Most of the items might not be glamorous and probably everyone is aware of it, thus their reason to shy away, but whoever has the courage to take them on will definitely win the respect of their peers and, most often, of the higher management's too.
## Has a second brain through the notes app
This might not come as a surprise, but in this era of information-rich work environments, making good use of this information is a huge advantage. While figuring out how to implement a new feature, fix a bug, etc. we stumble upon pieces of information that we stitch together to come up with the solution. Most often, we discard all this gathered information after we are done with the task and, more worryingly, next time we are in this situation, we will go back and gather it from scratch. 

What a senior would do is write down all his findings on this matter and put them in a safe place for later retrieval, so when he finds himself in a similar situation, the solution will be at his fingertips.

Another hidden benefit of taking notes is that it helps our brain store and better understand the information at hand, making it more likely that in the future, a similar situation will be recalled without the need to even going to the notes app.

## Bonus point
Finally, I would like to make a notable mention of an expected but most often not taken seriously duty of a senior, and that is **code review excellence**. While many code reviews are perceived as just skimming through the code and trying to find something (obviously) wrong, a senior will take this a step further and most often will pull the code locally and play with it himself to definitely make sure it's correct. This not only shows respect for the product being built but also for the code submitter, who expects a thoughtful evaluation.

For the time being, this is my list of lesser-known behaviors of senior engineers, and while I am definitely not there in most of them, they are all under my radar for improvement.
