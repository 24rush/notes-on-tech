Before I get going, let me show you what I will be talking about in this article.

What you just played with is a widget that sits at the core of [primiipasi.info](https://primiipasi.info) and is a niftly little Javascript "debugger" meant to help kids/beginners visualize how code...runs. The idea was to give them something to interact with so they could see how their code actually executes and how data is changed at runtime.

## The requirements
This would not be a full-blown debugger but a widget that could:
- _step through Javascript code_ line by line
- show _values of variables_ and visually signal when they get updated
- show the variables' _scopes_ during execution
- assist in learning more complex programming topics like bitwise operations, recursion, graph types, etc.

## The challenges
The first one was to figure out how to parse the code so I could _track the variables/functions_ being updated/called. For this, I wanted to be able to inject myself into different areas of the code so I could know what was going on in the script. [Esprima](https://esprima.org/index.html) to the rescue.

Secondly, a webpage is meant to be _single threaded_ consisting of only the main (UI) thread. Creating a debugger that would pause the execution of a script would definitely not work in a single threaded enviroment but [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) were created just for this, so another issue out the way.

Even if the code would be running in a separate thread from the UI's, I still needed to be able to pause/start its execution to create the step-over behaviour of a debugger. For this, one would need a _thread synchronization_ mechanism which in Javascript can be achieved using [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) -- that proved to be a can of worms that I will talk about later.

## Overall architecture
![](/images/posts/38a28092-71a9-437e-94f1-555470daf405.png)

What is obvious from the diagram is that the widget runs within two threads: 
- the _UI thread_ containing the interface and handling the interaction with the user
- the _worker thread_ handling the processing and execution of the debugged code

A brief explanation of the main actors:
- ```WidgetUI``` contains everything related to the UI of the widget (obviously!) meaning the [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) through which the source code enters the app, all the UI elements for the user to interact with the debugger, the HTML templates for displaying variables, functions, scopes, etc.
- ```CodeProcessor``` is the class responsible for tokenizing the code using [esprima](https://esprima.org/index.html) and generating the cookied code (containing the injected functions responsible for determining the state of the program)
- ```CodeExecutor``` is the class that handles the execution of the cookied code in a separate thread and handles the communication with the main thread via the cookied functions
- ```CodeExecutorProxy``` is just a wrapper over the ```CodeExecutor``` which is meant to be used from the main thread to communicate with the worker thread
- ```CodeDebugger``` is an orchestrator of all the messages/events going from the UI to the worker thread and vice versa
- ```NotificationBus``` is a pub/sub layer that facilitates the propagation of events from the worker thread (setting variables, calling functions, etc.) to the UI

## Code processing with Esprima
As mentioned earlier, I've used *esprima* to tokenize the code which is a very powerful code parser that returns a very nice tree structure containing all the elements of the script you give it alongside their index positions in the source code.

Let's take this script, for example:
![](/images/posts/2e9f30b8-5f5e-427a-afa9-fc64a1edc48a.png)

The program is returned as an array of esprima objects coresponding to each code construct it encountered. Every array position could also contain other arrays for the nested sub-constructs therefore, you would get a tree. 

The information provided by esprima is verbose but what I would generally be interested in is the type of construct, the name of the element being acted on (variable name, function call, etc.) and the index position in the source code.

### Cookies üç™
Knowing the code constructs and their source code positions, the next step was to figure out which ones were interesting considering the requirements (to track the variable assignments, function calls, scopes, etc.) and _insert specifically taylored functions (cookies)_ before or after each of them that would act as notifiers when the code reaches their execution. These cookie functions I would implement and append to the source code after processing.

Using the code snippet above, let's take line ```6``` as an example. 

![](/images/posts/d9c5a839-6fa8-411d-b50d-441a670f9382.png)

The ```let x = 1;``` variable declaration and initialization are represented by esprima with an object of type ```VariableDeclarator``` and alongside its properties, it also contains the ```range``` field with the position in the source code, from index ```52 to 62```. I would now know that between these positions in the source code there is an assignment happening.

If traversing this tree and encountering such a ```VariableDeclarator``` object, I would pick the variable's name and its corresponding index in the source code and store it in a separate structure which at the end of the traversal would help me place a cookie in the form of this function ```setVar('x', x)```.

In the 'cookied code' the ```let x = 1;``` declaration would be transformed into:
![](/images/posts/af20f52d-563f-4975-8241-ba543afcd5cf.png)
(the ```markcl()``` cookie is added manually before every new line)

Similarly, for ```FunctionDeclaration``` or ```BlockStatement``` objects, I would process them and generate cookies in the form of ```startScope(<scopeName>)``` which would signal that a new scope was about to start.

Here are some of these cookie functions and their use:
- ```setVar(varName, varValue)``` signals that a variable assignement is taking place
- ```start/endScope(scopeName)``` signals that a new scope has either started or ended
- ```marckl(lineNo)``` marks a new line, it's the function that basically halts the execution until the user clicks advance
- ```funcWrap(...)``` wrapper function over all user function calls

With this said, the initial code after injecting the cookies becomes:
```ts
;markcl(1); ;startScope('global');function boo() {
;markcl(2);  let x = 5;;setVar('x', x);
;markcl(3);  x = 6;;setVar('x', x);
}
  
;markcl(6);   let x = 1;;setVar('x', x);
;markcl(7);   console.log(x);
  
;markcl(9);   funcWrap( {f: () => { pushParams([]); startScope('!boo'); let ret = boo(); popParams([]); endScope('!boo');; return ret;}} );
;markcl(10); ;endScope('global');;
```

This sounds straightforward but a lot of heavy lifting was required to figure out what and where to inject each cookie. 

The complete source code can be found here ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [src/code-processor.ts](https://github.com/24rush/algo-vis/blob/develop/src/execution/code-processor.ts)

## Code execution
Executing the code involved passing the processed source code from the main thread to the worker and then sending the command to execute it, all orchestrated by a handshake step.

### The handshake step
This step involved sending three pieces of information:
- the processed source code
- a reference to the shared memory (```SharedArrayBuffer```) to be used for synchronization between the UI thread and the worker (more on it later)
- the 'execute' signal to start executing the code

Passing messages to a spawned worker thread is done using the [```Worker::postMessage```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage) function and for the handshake step it's used as follows:

- from the main thread a call to ```Worker.postMessage``` with a payload containing the command code and actual data is made:
    ```js
    sendWorkerMessage(cmd: CodeExecutorCommands, ...args: any[]) {
        this.worker.postMessage({
            cmd: cmd, // message type
            params: args // message payload
        });
    }
    ```

- on the receiving side (in the worker thread), the message is handled through the [```self.onmessage```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope/message_event) callback:

    ```js
    self.onmessage = (event) => {              
        switch (event.data.cmd) {            
            case CodeExecutorCommands.sharedMem:
                codex.setSharedMem(event.data.params[0]);
                break;
            case CodeExecutorCommands.setSourceCode:
                codex.setSourceCode(event.data.params[0]);
                break;
            case CodeExecutorCommands.execute:
                codex.execute();
                break;

            default:
                throw 'Cant handle cmd code ' + event.data.cmd;
        }
    };
    ```

The orchestrator class would then implement each step as follows:
```js
this.sendWorkerMessage(CodeExecutorCommands.setSourceCode, this.codeProcessor.getCode()); // pass the source code
this.sendWorkerMessage(CodeExecutorCommands.sharedMem, sharedMem); // send shared memory reference
this.sendWorkerMessage(CodeExecutorCommands.execute); // trigger the execution
```

and because _postMessage_(s) are just events in the queue of the worker thread that were sent from the main thread, they will also be processed in the same order in the worker thread as the one made in the main thread.

The complete source code can be found here ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [src/code-executor-proxy.ts](https://github.com/24rush/algo-vis/blob/develop/src/execution/code-executor-proxy.ts)

## Stepping over in code
The whole point of the widget was to offer the possibility to execute the code _line by line_ so users can see how each code line affects the state of the program.

The way this was implemented was by using a blocking cookie function (```markcl```) that would halt the execution of the script/thread until it got the signal to proceed from the user/main thread. This synchronization mechanism is handled in Javascript with [```Atomics```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics) and [```SharedArrayBuffers```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).

All this would not have been possible without the ```Atomics.wait``` function which uses a ```SharedArrayBuffer``` to verify if an index position from that buffer is of a certain value and if so, it sleeps until either a wake-up notification is received or a time-out -- more on this later.

### The synchronization mechanism:

Let's take these 2 lines as an example:
![](/images/posts/1490d50b-c3c5-4292-95f1-8af7501fdc0a.png)

1. Lines ```6-7``` after processing are translated into the cookied code on the right side (what ```eval``` receives)
2. Code is _eval-ed_ and execution reaches ```markcl(6);``` with the following implementation:
    ```js
    markcl(lineNumber: number) {
        let codex = codeExec(); //this

        // Send message back to UI to signal what the current line is
        self.postMessage({
            cmd: CodeExecutorCommands.markcl,
            params: Array.from([lineNumber])
        });

        // Block myself and wait for Proceed signal from user
        Atomics.store(codex.advanceFlag, 
                        CodeExecutorSlots.Main, CodeExecutorMessages.Wait);

        // Sleep as long as position CodeExecutorSlots.Main (0) of SharedArrayBuffer is = Wait
        let status = Atomics.wait(codex.advanceFlag, 
                                CodeExecutorSlots.Main, CodeExecutorMessages.Wait);

        // When wake up is received verify if value in CodeExecutorSlots.Aux (1) slot is stop signal (Stop)
        // therefore the wakeup was for stopping and not Proceed
        if (status == 'ok') {
            let auxFlag: number = Atomics.load(codex.advanceFlag, CodeExecutorSlots.Aux);

            if (auxFlag == CodeExecutorMessages.Stop) {
                throw "__STOP__";
            }
        }

        // if Aux slot value is not Stop then allow execution to move forward
    }
    ```

    What is happening:
    - a message is sent back to the UI thread notifying on what the current code line is so it can place the highlighted line in the code editor
    - ```Atomics.store(sharedMem, 0, Wait)``` is called placing the value ```Wait``` at index 0 of the shared memory. 
    - ```Atomics.wait(sharedMem, 0, Wait)``` is called signifying that the current worker thread will sleep as long as the value ```Wait``` will be stored at position 0 in the shared memory - _it basically blocks itself_

    At this point, the worker thread (debugged code) is stopped in the ```markcl(6)``` function call and what the user sees is something like this:
    ![](/images/posts/10b4a88b-425a-4b61-8fb3-a845040b903d.png)

3. When the user clicks 'Execute line' the following implementation is executed:
    ```js
    executeLine() {        
        // Wakeup the debugged code from the worker thread
        Atomics.notify(sharedMem, CodeExecutorSlots.Main);
    }    
    ```
4. The ```Atomics.notify``` call will wake up the debugger code (unblock the ```Atomics.wait``` function) which will resume execution.
5. Execution moves forward with the code below:
    ```js
      let x = 1;;setVar('x', x);
      markcl(7);
   ``` 
   and what the user now sees is:
    ![](/images/posts/44aa8951-0ab9-4e78-b3f1-b7723d14756d.png)
    - notice that line ```7``` is now highlighted and variable ```x``` was created with value ```1```

### Implications of using ```SharedArrayBuffer``` ü™±
```SharedArrayBuffers``` and _high performance counters_ are two browser features that require special security requirements as they were used in the past in attacks like Spectre. 

For this reason, when using one of these features, your website needs to opt-in for _cross-origin isolation_ which means that resources that use these features need to be vetted by the owning server and will be guaranteed to never share a browsing context group with an evil actor. You can see it as a way of being able to _isolate these powerful features to pages that you own_ and have the browser guarantee that they will never be mixed with external resources that might take advantage of them.

This is a vast topic I cannot explain in a few paragraphs but here are a few of the best resources [```1```](https://web.dev/articles/coop-coep), [```2```](https://web.dev/articles/cross-origin-isolation-guide), [```3```](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/cross-browser-with-coop-coep/) for further research.

In a nutshell, the implications for you of _cross-origin isolation_ are:
- the top-level document that uses one of these features needs to be served to the client with the following headers:
    ```bash
    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    ```
- as cross-origin isolation disables communication between your document and any other window it might open, it will _break most of the integrations_ you will want to do on that page like OAuth, payments, ads and even embedding a Youtube video iframe

#### Compromise solution
There is mitigation (which was used in this blog) in that all pages that use the debugging widget (therefore ```SharedArrayBuffer```) are served from a separate ```/i``` (_isolation_) route which is the only route that will be returned in cross isolation (with COEP & COOP headers) and not the rest of the pages that are served from ```/```(root domain). 

This way you can use embeddings in these pages and only loose this capability in the pages from the ```/i``` (isolated) route. You can test if a page is cross-origin isolated by querying the ```self.crossOriginIsolated``` global property in the console of the browser.

Below, you can see my ```vercel.json``` for this solution:
```json
{
    "headers": [
        {
        "source": "/i/(.*)", // all blog posts that use SharedArrayBuffer will be served from <domain>/i
        "headers": [
            ...
            { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" },
            { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }
        ]
        },
        {
        "source": "/(.*)bundle\\.js", // the scripts that actually use SAB
        "headers": [
            ...
            { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" },
            { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }
        ]
        }
    ]
}
```
...now let's circle back to the widget.

## The user interface 
Whenever one of the cookie functions gets executed, a message is sent back to the main thread to figure out what happened, after which a new message is sent to update the UI in correspondence with that event.

![](/images/posts/bc640bc0-eaf1-47f9-8a31-8d42b6d1f715.png)

Let's take for example the creation of a new scope. 

1. The ```startScope('global')``` cookie function is executed in the worker thread (```CodeExecutor```) which sends a message to the parent thread (main thread):

    ```js
    startScope(scopeName: string) {
        self.postMessage({
            cmd: CodeExecutorCommands.startScope,
            params: Array.from(arguments)
        });
    }
    ```

2. The main thread receives it (```CodeExecutorProxy```) and puts it on the ```NotificationBus```:
    ```js
    this.worker.onmessage = (event) => {
            let params = event.data.params;

            switch (event.data.cmd) {
                ...
                case CodeExecutorCommands.startScope:
                    this.notificationBus.startScope(params[0]);
                    break;
            }
    }
    ```

    which calls all subscribers to the ```startScope``` message:
    ```js
    startScope(scopeName: string) {
        for (const notifier of this.notificationObservers) {
            if ('startScope' in notifier)
                notifier.startScope(scopeName);
        }
    }
    ```

3. The only subscriber for this message is the ```CodeDebugger``` class which processes the message (the ```Magic``` box) and delivers its counterpart to the UI:
    ```js
    startScope(scopeName: string) {
        // Update internal state
        this.scopeMonitor.scopeStart(scopeName);

        // Send the processed message to the UI
        this.notificationBus.onEnterScopeVariable(scopeName);
    }
    ```

4. This message (```onEnterScopeVariable```) is then received by the widget's UI and handled in the form of generating an HTML fragment for the new scope and placing it in the corresponding location in the DOM:

    An oversimplified version:
    ```js
    onEnterScopeVariable(scopeName: string) {
        // Generate HTML string from template
        let rendered = MustacheIt.render(this.scopeTemplateHTML, 
                                        { 
                                            scopeName: scopeName, 
                                            scope_idx: Scopes.scope_idx++ 
                                        });

        // Create HTMLElement from string template
        let scopeHtmlElement = DOMmanipulator.fromTemplate(rendered);

        // Add it to the DOM
        this.scene.append(scopeHtmlElement);
    }
    ```
    and the result will be that the UI will now display a new scope, in this example the empty _GLOBAL SCOPE_
    ![](http://localhost:4321/images/posts/10b4a88b-425a-4b61-8fb3-a845040b903d.png)

### The ```Magic``` box
As you can imagine, tracking all variables and function calls in a program is not an easy task and in the diagram I've placed all this logic in the ```Magic``` box. In a nutshell, what happens inside is:
- keep track of all started/ended scopes
- keep track of active variables and their scope (identifying the scope of a variable was the most challenging part as the only information I would get from the cookies was that a variable with a name was set a certain value and then I would need to figure out to _which variable from which scope_ it was referring to)

The code for the Magic box can be found ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [src/code-debugger.ts](https://github.com/24rush/algo-vis/blob/develop/src/execution/code-debugger.ts)

## Advanced features
Besides the feature of stepping through Javascript code, the widget is also capable in helping understand some more complex programming topics like: _bitwise operations, references, recursion, graph data types_ and more.

You can find them on [primiipasi.info](https://primiipasi.info)[```RO```] but I will leave you with one example that is aimed to helping visualize how a graph is built from an adjacency matrix.

<Algovis>
```js
let lista_adiacenta = {
    1: [2, 3, 4],
    2: [1],
    3: [1, 4],
    4: [3, 1]
};

let graf = new Graph();
graf.fromAdjacencyList(lista_adiacenta);

```
